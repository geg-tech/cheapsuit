## 7/10/25 - cookin a card like no other
I had this concept cookin' for a while (since BakeBuild), and after seeing all of the Hacker Card PCBs being submitted recently, I was inspired to give my own take on the [guide](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) with all of the new experience I've gained from my past hardware projects. <br/>
> warning: lore drop

I've had the idea of making some form of Hack Club playing card for a while (partly due to my crippling poker and balatro addiction), which I took with my BakeBuild submission a while back in April, making custom pixel art of Orpheus on a joker card inspired by Balatro. <br/>
Now looking back, I can definitely improve this idea through a Hacker Card, which contains a much slimmer form factor, custom graphics, and some form of interactivity with the NFC chip. I've improved my skills in hardware, art, and design across all of my projects, and I'm finally ready to give this idea it's due justice. <br/>

> also inspired by the song ["Cheap Suits"](https://youtu.be/87i0RargAcA?si=6u_HbRG08Tu_UAo9) by mekaloton and OH MY GOD I LOVE THIS SONG SO MUCH AKJHDLSAHDASD I LOVE GAMBLING

To start off, I decided that the card will have the same dimensions as a Bicycle playing card, which is 2.5 inches wide and 3.5 inches tall (88.9mm tall and 63.5mm wide), with a 3mm fillet on the corners. I then went into my drawing software and made a quick mockup of how I wanted the card to look like. <br/>

Since PCB manufacturers will make 5 copies of one PCB, I can't make 5 different cards with differing suits, so I'll have to merge all 4 into one cohesive design. I also want to design a hardcore electronic vibe with the card, using strong and sharp lines. <br/>
I plan on using *8* LEDs, but I also worry that the low power from the NFC will not be able to handle all of the LEDs at full power, which is why I also plan on having at *least* 4 LEDs to maintain symmetry and to match the suits. <br/>

From there, I started to brainstorm some more about the design, adding comments about how I wanted the card to look like. <br/>

I wanted to maintain a hardcore-cyberpunk aesthetic, but also incorporate some poker table or casino vibes with it, maybe using art-deco themes due to their similarity with cyberpunk of having sharp and defined lines. <br/>
