## 7/10/25 - cookin a card like no other
I had this concept cookin' for a while (since BakeBuild), and after seeing all of the Hacker Card PCBs being submitted recently, I was inspired to give my own take on the [guide](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) with all of the new experience I've gained from my past hardware projects. <br/>
> warning: lore drop

I've had the idea of making some form of Hack Club playing card for a while (partly due to my crippling poker and balatro addiction), which I took with my BakeBuild submission a while back in April, making custom pixel art of Orpheus on a joker card inspired by Balatro. <br/>
Now looking back, I can definitely improve this idea through a Hacker Card, which contains a much slimmer form factor, custom graphics, and some form of interactivity with the NFC chip. I've improved my skills in hardware, art, and design across all of my projects, and I'm finally ready to give this idea it's due justice. <br/>
