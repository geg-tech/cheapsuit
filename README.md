I've had the idea of a Hack Club playing card for a *long while* (ever since my BakeBuild submission back in April), and with some extra time on my hands and inpsiration from other people submitting hacker cards, I decided to revamp this idea into a hacker card PCB with fully custom art! <br/>

## extras/inspirations

*inspirations*:
* **Cyberpunk 2077** - Main inspiration behind the cyberpunk/hardcore tech theming
* [**Cheap Suits**](https://youtu.be/87i0RargAcA) by *mekaloton* - Main inspiration for the whole suits/gambling theme; inspired the *Moon* alternate back side; this entire project was named after this song lmao
* **Balatro** - Also a main inspiration for the gambling/suits theme
* **Bicycle Playing Cards** - Main inspiration behind the chosen back side design
* **Highway/Undercity/Hack Club** - (oddly enough) The original source of the cyberpunk aesthetic I wanted with this card; inspired much of the art for the suits, the Undercitified Hack Club logo, and the Highway Stars
* **my calculus teacher** - he got me addicted to poker

*fun facts*:
* I drew two alternate back sides to the playing card, being the *Moon* and the *Compass*!
* ^ The *Moon* was inspired off of the background of [Cheap Suits](https://youtu.be/87i0RargAcA) and traditional tarot cards
* ^^ The *Compass* had an original theming for being a *compass* for Highway (get it)

* This project initially had the name of *The Hack* in my head, being named after the Balatro joker of the same name and also matching with *Hack* Club
* ^ i then found out that this was not a poker/cards term, but instead is slang for cliche and unoriginal jokes

* I hid the logos for Highway and Undercity on the back side of the card, as well as the Hack Club flag :3
